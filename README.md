# SkwisRangos / Spigot 1.10.2
Spigot plugin of Minecraft. Players can get promoted by spending virtual money of the Minecraft server

Compatible with Vault and PermissionsEx plugins.

Hello, this is my 1st serious plugin developed for Spigot (Minecraft).
It hasn't been tested thoroughly yet, and the code might be sloppy and not efficient.
I'll be improving this plugin slowly, when I have enough time to get hands to work.

Any kind of constructive feedback will be welcome. Thank you for your time.

PS: Bear in mind that the only command in the plugin (yet) is in Spanish. That'll change later.
PS2: Some settings in the code are written just for fun, like the "You're POOR!!!" (when the user can't afford a higher rank).
